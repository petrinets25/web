### Accommodation

Due to the variety of the accommodation in Paris (with various prices and comfort levels), we do not recommend any specific hotel.

Hotels located within central Paris along mÃ©tro line 12 may be a good choice.

For budget accommodation, [UCPA Sport Station Youth Hostel](https://www.ucpa.com/hostel-paris-19/spot) might be a good option (which we have not tested though). It is located in Rosa Parks, a 10 minute bus ride or a 30 minute walk to the conference location.
