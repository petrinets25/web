__Petri Net games, examples and quizzes for education, contest and fun__.
*24 June 2025*

The workshop aims to attract short papers that present examples for the use of
Petri nets for elegant modeling, analysis or problem solving. The examples
should be comprehensible, self-contained and ideally demonstrate advantages of
Petri Net techniques compared to other approaches. A particular objective of
the workshop is the collection of examples that can be used for exemplary
modeling or application of analysis concepts in education.
