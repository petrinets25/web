PETRI NETS 2025

46th international conference on application and theory of Petri nets and
concurrency
============================================================

Paris, France
23-27 June 2025
https://petrinets25.github.io/web/

## Paper Submission
Petri Nets 2025 solicits high quality papers reporting research results and/or
tools related to the topics mentioned below.

* Regular papers (20 pages LNCS excluding references) must describe original
  results pertaining to the development of the theory of Petri nets and
  distributed and concurrent systems in general, new results extending the
  applicability of Petri nets, or case studies, application and experience
  reports pertinent to the practical use of Petri nets and concurrency.

* Tool papers (10 pages LNCS excluding references) must describe a computer
  tool based on Petri nets (not an application of the tool or the theory behind
  the tool). The tool should be available for use by other groups (but not
  necessarily for free). The submission should indicate how the reviewers can
  get access to the tool (this must be for free). The tool will be demonstrated
  in the Tool Exhibition, in addition to being presented in a conference talk.

All papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere.
Papers must be written in English using the Springer LNCS format,
including line numbers (e.g., https://ctan.org/pkg/lineno LaTeX
package) and submitted electronically (as a PDF file) by the deadline using
EasyChair(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=petrinets2025).

## Topics of Interest
Topics specific to Petri Nets
* Analysis and synthesis, structure and behavior of nets
* System design and model-driven development using nets
* Relationships between Petri nets and other approaches
* Net-based semantical, logical and algebraic calculi
* Higher-level net models (colored nets, timed nets, etc.)
* Stochastic net models
* Verification and model checking using nets
* Process discovery and conformance checking
* Computer tools for nets
* Standardization of nets
* Experience reports describing applications of nets to different kinds of
  systems and application fields (e.g., flexible manufacturing systems, office
  automation, real-time systems, workflows, embedded systems, process mining,
  biological systems, supervisory control, health and medical systems,
  protocols and networks, environmental systems, Internet and Web services,
  hardware, e-commerce and trading, telecommunications, programming languages,
  railway networks, performance evaluation, component based development,
  operations research)

General topics of interest related to concurrency
* Application of concurrency to system design: formal models for designing
  computer systems with concurrent behavior, applied research aimed at
  designing computer systems which exhibit concurrency, etc.
* Model checking and verification of distributed systems
* Verification of infinite-state or parametric systems
* Causality/partial order theory of concurrency
* Educational issues related to concurrency
* New developments in the theory of concurrency
* Modeling of hardware and biological systems

Papers presenting original research on application or theory of Petri nets, as
well as contributions addressing topics relevant to the general field of
distributed and concurrent systems or focused on applications of concurrency to
system design are sought.

The language of the conference is English, and its proceedings will be
published by Springer-Verlag in LNCS. 

All accepted papers will be considered for an Outstanding Paper award. Authors
of selected papers presented at the conference will be invited to submit an
extended version that will be further reviewed for inclusion into a special
issue of a renowned journal.

## Tool Exhibition
An exhibition of Petri net tools will take place on Wednesday June 25. It
consists of informal demonstrations for small groups/individuals and there are
no scheduled talks. Requests for participation in the tool exhibition must be
sent to the Tool Exhibition chairs by the deadline stated at the top of this
Call for Papers. They should include a link to the Web pages for the tool (or a
short description of the tool). The demonstrators should bring their own
laptops, while the organisers may be requested to give access to the Internet.


## Courses, Workshops and Tutorials
The main conference takes place from Wednesday 25 to Friday 27. The two days
before the main conference also offer a wide range of activities. The Petri Net
Course takes place from Monday 23 to Tuesday 24. It offers a thorough
introduction to Petri nets in half-days and full-day modules. For successful
participation in the entire course, including preparation and examination, two
credit points (ECTS) will be awarded. Each module of the course can also be
taken separately, without any credit. Detailed descriptions of Workshops and
Tutorials will be made available via the conference Web page.

It is also possible to arrange Meetings and Courses related to Petri Nets.
Submissions for such activities must contain a 2-5 page description. They must
be received by the Workshops and Tutorials chairs via email no later than
January 15, 2025.

## Organization
The 46th annual international Petri Nets conference will be organised by the
LoVe (Logics and Verification) team at the Université Sorbonne Paris Nord
(France) jointly with members of the MeFoSyLoMa group.

The conference will take place at the Campus Condorcet.
