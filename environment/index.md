# Environment 🌱

🚧 **page still in progress** 🚧

Petri Nets 2025 will try to reduce as much as possible its carbon footprint.
Here are some actions we take:

* 🚅 We encourage participants to not come by plane whenever possible; we offer a discount for participants coming from long distance by train. As a reminder, a medium distance travel within Europe by plane wastes about **[100 times more CO$_2$](https://www.ecoco2.com/blog/empreinte-carbone-avion-vs-train/)** than by train.
* 🗓 We encourage participants coming from long distance to stay longer, by visiting a lab the week before or after Petri Nets. See the [ETAPS 2023 Extended Stay Support Scheme (ESSS)](https://etaps.org/2023/esss/) for examples of labs you might be interested in visiting.
* 🍽 We will reduce the use of disposable crockery as much as possible.
* 🥤 Participants will be offered a reusable cup, and are encouraged to use it during and after the conference.
* 🧰 We will not offer any disposable goodie.
* 🗒 Notepads will not be provided by default (some should be available on request though).
* 🥙 We will provide a large vegetarian offer, and encourage participants to go for such vegetarian options.
* 📚 Sadly, we were not allowed to go for only _online_ proceedings, therefore wasting a lot of paper, considering most participants will never open the paper proceedings.
