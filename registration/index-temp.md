# Information for registration

Due to complications and limitations of the CNRS platform "Azur colloques", registration is a _three-step_ process:

## Step 1: information
First, you should fill in a form to express your interests in the workshops (if any), for statistics only, and your dietary restrictions (if any).

The URL of the first form is ***TODO***.


## Step 2: pre-registration form
After filling the aforementioned form, your will read the URL of the second form, which is a pre-registration form.

In that URL, you will find _"Petri Nets 2025"_ in the list of _Open Conferences_.
Then, click on _"Prerecord"_ to enter your personal information and select the appropriate _Category_ according to the pricing list.

## Step 3: payment
Once your pre-registration is validated (which may take up to 48 hours), you
will receive an email with a link to pay your registration. If you do not
receive this email within 48 hours, please check your junk or spam folder.


For any issue with registration, please contact the local organizing chairs: pn2025@petrinet.net
