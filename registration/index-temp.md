# Information for registration

Due to complications and limitations coming from the CNRS platform "Azur colloques", registration is a _three-step_ process:

## Step 1: information
First, you should fill in a form to express your interests in the workshops (if any), for statistics only, and your dietary restrictions (if any)

The URL of the first form is ***TODO***.


## Step 2: pre-registration form
After filling the aforementioned form, your will read the URL of the second form, which is a pre-registration form.

You will find _"Petri Nets 2025"_ in the list of _Open Conferences_.
Then, click on _"Prerecord"_ to enter your personal information and select the appropriate _Category_ according to the pricing list.

## Step 3: payment
Only after we validate your pre-registration (which can take up to 48 hours), you will receive an email with a link to pay your registration.
If you do not receive this email within 48 hours, please check your junk/spam folder.

For any issue with registration, please contact the local organizing chairs: pn2025@petrinet.net
