## Registration process

Due to complications and limitations of the CNRS platform "Azur colloques", registration is a _three-step_ process:

### Step 1: information
First, you should fill in a form to express your interests in the workshops (if any), for statistics only, and your dietary restrictions (if any).

The URL of the first form is
**[http://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/limesurvey/index.php/781864?lang=en](http://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/limesurvey/index.php/781864?lang=en)**

### Step 2: pre-registration form
After filling the aforementioned form, your will read the URL of the second form, which is a pre-registration form.

In that URL, you will find _"Petri Nets 2025"_ in the list of _Open Conferences_.
Then, click on _"Prerecord"_ to enter your personal information and select the appropriate _Category_ according to the pricing list.

### Step 3: payment
Once your pre-registration is validated (which may take up to 48 hours), you
will receive an email with a link to pay your registration. If you do not
receive this email within 48 hours, please check your junk or spam folder.
